## About
Synapse+ is an *external, lightweight and user-friendly interface* completely made in [*Node.js*](https://nodejs.org) using various libraries for the usage ease of the end-user. Its roots are grounded on the simplicity aesthetic standards we have today.

However, we're sorry to inform you that this project awaits the release version 3 update of Synapse for both forward and backward compatibility to release. Stay tuned until then!
