## About
Synapse+ is an *hackable¹, external, extensive, lightweight and user-friendly interface* completely made in [*Node.js*](https://nodejs.org) using various libraries for the usage ease of the end-user. Its roots are grounded on the simplicity aesthetic standards we have today.

¹: hackable used in the context as in atom is a hackable text editor.
## Overview
<ul>
    <li>Synapse+ gives you a chance to experience a refined user interface that doesn't look like buttons and textboxes smashed up and mixed together in a window effortlessly.</li>
    <li>You can customize it all you want. We deliver a designer kit with your installation of Synapse+ that eases your tinkering of every inch of the interface! Seriously, no limits; it's our motto.</li>
    <li>Along with the looks, it delivers anything the V3 interface has to, and even more. You can choose any of the domains we already included in, such as Gist, Pastebin, Hastebin, Ghostbin, and if those aren't a cup of your tea, you can even add your own custom domain by either uploading an API or using FTP.</li>
    <li>Themes. We're sick of themes that just change the texts and slap a few pictures on the editor, so while we took it further with designer kit, we also have a gallery of themes that's not limited to just the themes we included in. For users, by users.</li>
    <li>Built-in suppoort for community-driven solutions, such as Luauth, Boronide, Luraph and Robloxscripts.</li>
 </ul>
